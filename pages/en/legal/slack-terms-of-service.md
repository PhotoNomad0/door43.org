## Purpose

We use the [Slack](https://slack.com/downloads) messaging app to communicate quickly and efficiently. Our team name is Team43. Sign up at [Team43 Slack](https://door43.org/en/slack).

## Privacy

All of the public channels in Team43 Slack are publicly logged (available at [https://team.door43.org/logs][d43-logs]). If you are concerned about privacy use a pseudonym. Your email address will be accessible to others in our Team43 Slack team.

## Agreement

The actions you take in Team43 Slack should be in agreement with the Door43 [Statement of Faith][sof].

## Conduct

Please refrain from repeated posting of the same content. However, if your question has not been answered adequately and has been buried by other messages, please donâ€™t hesitate to ask again.

Discussions should be Christ honoring, non-libelous, and courteous. Posting of solicitations and ads in the group or in direct messages will not be tolerated. This is not a venue for expressing defamatory opinions against any ideology or faith. Please report comments that are disruptive or off-topic to [@ben_jore](https://git.door43.org/ben_jore), [@jag3773](https://git.door43.org/jag3773), or [@timjore](https://git.door43.org/timjore.).

## Effectiveness

Use Slack instead of email if at all possible.
