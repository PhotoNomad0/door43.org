# door43.org

This is the source for door43.org website.  Note that it does not include the files that show up at door43.org/u/ as those are created by the [tX conversion app](https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/door43.org/wiki/tX-Development-Architecture).

## Project Overview

The http://door43.org site provides a front end view to all of the content in the Door43 ecosystem.  The source content on http://git.door43.org is converted into HTML and uploaded to the correct location on http://door43.org.

Whenever a source repository is updated, it notifies (via webhook) the conversion app to convert the content and publish it online.  A repository like https://git.door43.org/jag3773/ULB-pt-br will become a published web page at http://door43.org/u/jag3773/ULB-pt-br/.

The pages outside of the `/u/` location on the site are generated by Jekyll and provide localized navigation, Door43 project information, and curated content recommendations for each language.

## Developer Quickstart Information

### Door43.org Jekyll Site

#### Installation

To setup a development environment for developing on this site, you need to run the following commands (after cloning this repo):

    cd door43.org
    bundle install

If you do not have the `bundle` executable, then you'll need to run `sudo gem install bundle` first.

#### Updating dependencies

    bundle update

#### Publishing Setup

There are four branches that are built in a develop environment:

* `develop`
* `master`
* `phil`
* `codemis`

Each of those is available at [branch_name].door43.org (e.g. http://develop.door43.org).

The master branch (at http://master.door43.og) is *exactly* what should show up on production.

#### Pre Production Testing

After testing locally, push your changes to one of the development branches.  They will then be visible at http://[branch_name].door43.org/ within seconds.  Supported development branches are `develop`, `phil`, `codemis`.

#### Push to Production

After pre production testing, merge your branch into the `master` branch.  You can do this by running `make publish` if your changes are in `develop`.
Your changes should be visible within 5 minutes on http://door43.org.
